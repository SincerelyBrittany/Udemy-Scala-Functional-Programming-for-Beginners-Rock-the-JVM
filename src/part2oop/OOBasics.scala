//A class organizes data and behavior that is code


//instantiation means concrete realization and memory that is actual memory speaces that conform to the code
//and the data structure that the class describes.

/*
To instantiate is to create such an instance by, for example, defining one particular variation of
object within a class, giving it a name, and locating it in some physical place. 1) In object-oriented programming,
some writers say that you instantiate a class to create an object, a concrete instance of the class.
